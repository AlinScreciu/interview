Your {{ include "helm.name" . }} application has been successfully deployed.

{{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
Since you have enabled Ingress, you can access your application at the hosts you've configured:
{{- range .Values.ingress.hosts }}
http://{{ .host }}{{ (first .paths).path }}
{{- end }}

{{- else if eq .Values.service.type "LoadBalancer" }}
Your service is exposed via a LoadBalancer. You can get the external IP by running:
kubectl get svc {{ include "helm.fullname" . }} --template="{{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{.ip}}{{end}}"

{{- else }}
Your service is only exposed within the cluster. To access it from your local machine, you can use port-forwarding.

Run the following command in a separate terminal:
kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "helm.fullname" . }} {{ .Values.service.port }}:{{ .Values.app.port }}

You can now access the application at http://localhost:{{ .Values.service.port }}

{{- end }}

Have a great day!
